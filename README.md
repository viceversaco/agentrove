## Why Claudex

- Claude Code as the execution harness, exposed through a self-hosted web UI
- One workflow across Anthropic, OpenAI, GitHub Copilot, OpenRouter, and custom Anthropic-compatible endpoints
- Anthropic Bridge routing for non-Anthropic providers while preserving Claude Code behavior
- Isolated sandbox backends (Docker, host)
- Extension surface: MCP servers, skills, agents, slash commands, prompts, and marketplace plugins
- Provider switching with shared working context

## Core Architecture

```text
React/Vite Frontend
  -> FastAPI Backend
  -> PostgreSQL + Redis (web/docker mode)
  -> SQLite + in-memory cache/pubsub (desktop mode)
  -> Sandbox runtime (Docker/Host)
  -> Claude Code CLI + claude-agent-sdk
```

### Claude Code harness

Claudex runs chats through `claude-agent-sdk`, which drives the Claude Code CLI in the selected sandbox. This keeps Claude Code-native behavior for tools, session flow, permission modes, and MCP orchestration.

### Anthropic Bridge for non-Anthropic providers

For OpenAI, OpenRouter, and Copilot providers, Claudex starts `anthropic-bridge` inside the sandbox and routes Claude Code requests through:

- `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3456`
- provider-specific auth secrets such as `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` and `GITHUB_COPILOT_TOKEN`
- provider-scoped model IDs like `openai/gpt-5.2-codex`, `openrouter/moonshotai/kimi-k2.5`, `copilot/gpt-5.2-codex`

```text
Claudex UI
  -> Claude Agent SDK + Claude Code CLI
  -> Anthropic-compatible request shape
  -> Anthropic Bridge (OpenAI/OpenRouter/Copilot)
  -> Target provider model
```

For Anthropic providers, Claudex uses your Claude auth token directly. For custom providers, Claudex calls your configured Anthropic-compatible `base_url`.

## Key Features

- Claude Code-native chat execution through `claude-agent-sdk`
- Anthropic Bridge provider routing with provider-scoped models (`openai/*`, `openrouter/*`, `copilot/*`)
- Workspace-based project organization with per-workspace sandboxes
- Multi-sandbox runtime (Docker/Host)
- MCP + custom skills/agents/commands + plugin marketplace
- Checkpoint restore and chat forking from any prior message state
- Streaming architecture with resumable SSE events and explicit cancellation
- Built-in recurring task scheduler (in-process async, no worker service)

## Workspaces

Workspaces are the top-level organizational unit. Each workspace owns a dedicated sandbox and groups all related chats under one project context.

### Source types

- **Empty** — creates a new empty directory in the sandbox
- **Git clone** — clones a repository (HTTPS or SSH) into a fresh sandbox
- **Local folder** — mounts an existing directory from the host filesystem (host sandbox only)

### Sandbox isolation

Each workspace gets its own sandbox instance (Docker container or host process). Chats within a workspace share the same filesystem, installed tools, and `.claude` configuration. Switching between workspaces switches the entire execution environment.

### Per-workspace sandbox provider

When creating a workspace you can override the default sandbox provider (Docker or Host). The provider is locked at creation time — all chats in that workspace use the same provider.

### Workspace lifecycle

- Creating a workspace provisions the sandbox and initializes it with your settings (GitHub token, env vars, skills, agents, slash commands)
- Deleting a workspace soft-deletes all its chats and destroys the sandbox container

## Quick Start (Web)

### Requirements

- Docker + Docker Compose

### Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mng-dev-ai/claudex.git
cd claudex
docker compose -p claudex-web -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Stop and logs

```bash
docker compose -p claudex-web -f docker-compose.yml down
docker compose -p claudex-web -f docker-compose.yml logs -f
```

## Desktop (macOS)

Desktop mode uses Tauri with a bundled Python backend sidecar on `localhost:8081`, with local SQLite storage.

### Download prebuilt app

- Apple Silicon DMG: [Latest Release](https://github.com/Mng-dev-ai/claudex/releases/latest)

### How it works

When running in desktop mode:

- Tauri hosts the frontend in a native macOS window
- the sidecar backend process serves the API on `8081`
- desktop uses local SQLite plus in-memory cache/pubsub (no Postgres/Redis dependency required for desktop mode)

```text
Tauri Desktop App
  -> React frontend (.env.desktop)
  -> bundled backend sidecar (localhost:8081)
  -> local SQLite database
```

### Build and run from source

Requirements:

- Node.js
- Rust

Dev workflow:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run desktop:dev
```

Build (unsigned dev):

```bash
cd frontend
npm run desktop:build
```

App bundle output:

- `frontend/src-tauri/target/release/bundle/macos/Claudex.app`

Desktop troubleshooting:

- Backend unavailable: wait for sidecar startup to finish
- Database errors: verify local app data directory permissions
- Port conflict: free port `8081` if already in use

## Provider Setup

Configure providers in `Settings -> Providers`.

- `anthropic`: paste token from `claude setup-token`
- `openai`: authenticate with OpenAI device flow in UI
- `copilot`: authenticate with GitHub device flow in UI
- `openrouter`: add OpenRouter API key and model IDs
- `custom`: set Anthropic-compatible `base_url`, token, and model IDs

### Model examples

- OpenAI/Codex: `gpt-5.2-codex`, `gpt-5.2`, `gpt-5.3-codex`
- OpenRouter catalog examples: `moonshotai/kimi-k2.5`, `minimax/minimax-m2.1`, `google/gemini-3-pro-preview`
- Custom gateways: models like `GLM-5`, `M2.5`, or private org-specific endpoints (depends on your backend compatibility)

## Shared Working Context

Switching providers within a workspace does not require a new workflow:

- Same sandbox filesystem/workdir
- Same `.claude` resources (skills, agents, commands)
- Same MCP configuration in Claudex
- Same workspace and chat history

This is the main value of using Claude Code as the harness while changing inference providers behind Anthropic Bridge.
